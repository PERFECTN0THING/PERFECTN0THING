do not copy/take major inspo from me!! minor inspo is fine. spam followers please dni, i'll soft block you if you do. byi keep these things about me in mind: i am autistic, socially anxious, and have a hard time socializing. i apologize if i seem dry/awkward at first. i usually don't like interacting or iniating convos first. i am also forgetful and have difficulty concentrating and processing information quickly. i'm usually afk since i tend to get overwhelmed or burnt out quickly, or if i have something to do. i promise i am not ignoring you. i am also NOT comfortable with kys/die jokes. if you wanna interact please w2i, and just be chill and patient thanks
