## BYI: 
please ask before c+h with me. if you're a friend please ask before going to my location. i am NOT comfortable with kys/die jokes. i have autism, social anxiety, + other mental health issues. i have a hard time socializing, and i am very socially awkard so i may seem dry/unengaged at first. i may struggle with knowing what to say and responding to messages. i also might say things that are accidentally weird/rude, i apologize as this is not my intention so please let me know if you're uncomfy. i dislike interacting first, i still do it occasionally but i'm kinda awkward. i am forgetful and have difficulty concentrating and processing information quickly, please be patient. if you wanna interact just be chill and w2i please.
