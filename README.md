do not copy/take major inspo from me!! minor inspo is fine. usually afk either cause i'm busy or i'm stressed/burnt out. w2i preferred.

BYI: please ask before c+h with me. if you're a friend please ask before going to my location. i am NOT comfortable with kys/die jokes. i have autism, social anxiety, + other mental health issues. i have a hard time socializing, and i am very socially awkard so i may seem dry/unengaged at first. i may struggle with knowing what to say and responding to messages. i also might say things that are accidentally weird/rude, i apologize as this is not my intention so please let me know if you're uncomfy. i dislike interacting first, i still do it occasionally but i'm kinda awkward. i am forgetful and have difficulty concentrating and processing information quickly, please be patient. if you wanna interact just be chill and w2i please. feel free to send me stuff on strawpage or atabook :)

DNI: basic criteria, spam followers, under 13/over 20, roleplayers, if you make fun of any of my interests, AND if you ONLY interact with me because you are romantically interested in me. i WILL block you if you do this. this has happened several times and i'd like to make it clear that i am NOT interested in romantic relationships, thanks.
